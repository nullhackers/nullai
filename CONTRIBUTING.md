## Branch Naming Convention

When creating a new branch for your changes, please use the following naming convention:

-   `feat/your-feature-name`: For adding a new feature or enhancement.
-   `fix/issue-description`: For fixing a bug or issue.
-   `chore/task-description`: For changes that do not relate to a fix or feature.
-   `style/style-description` : For change in UI.

**For Example:**
-     style/footer
## Commit Message Guidelines

Please follow the **Conventional Commit guidelines** for writing commit messages. Each commit message should include a type, a subject line, an optional body, and an optional footer.

Here's an example of a well-formed commit message:
-   `feat`  – a new feature is introduced with the changes
-   `fix`  – a bug fix has occurred
-   `chore`  – changes that do not relate to a fix or feature and don't modify src or test files (for example updating dependencies)
-   `style`  – changes that do not affect the meaning of the code, likely related to code formatting such as white-space, missing semicolons, and so on.

**For Example:**
-     style: Refactor footer component layout

## Code Style and Guidelines

To maintain consistency and readability, please adhere to the code style and guidelines specified in the project. Write clear and concise code, and document your code as necessary.
